# Note on provinence: Julien Girard asked me to work on this plugin back in
#    2019. He provided NEC4 antenna pattern (E-field direction grids) files
#    created by Didier Charrier. He asked me to make NenuFAR plugin as similar
#    as possible to the analogous plugin for LOFAR, which meant using the 
#    Hamakers model, and a normalization of 1 for the maximum Jones.
